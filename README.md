# im2weight

this is a collection of scripts used to train an image based neural net for detecting someone's weight from images.

### gettin the images

i used [reddit-fetch](https://github.com/nobodyme/reddit-fetch) to pull the images down from reddit's [progresspics](https://www.reddit.com/r/progresspics/top) page


more details to come but check out the [jupyter notebook](https://github.com/stedn/im2weight/blob/master/weight_from_ims.ipynb)
